## Mini-Pascal Compiler

Version 0.3.1

This project, written in Java 8, is a compiler which parses Mini-Pascal code to generate MIPS assembly code.

## Installation

The current version of this project is capable of parsing mini-pascal code as a valid program. If the input is parsed as valid, a full table of the identifiers used in the pascal program can also be printed to a file. Please refer to the Software Design Document for a more thorough description of how to set up and run the pascal parser.
