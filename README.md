## Micro-Pascal Compiler
Version 0.4.1

This project, written in Java 8, is a compiler which parses Micro-Pascal code to generate MIPS assembly code.

## Installation
The current version of this project is capable of parsing mini-pascal code as a valid program.
If the program is parsed as valid, a syntax tree as well as a table of identifiers used within
the program are printed to respective files within the /src/compiler directory. Please refer
to the Software Design Document for a more thorough description of how to set up and run the
micro-pascal parser.
